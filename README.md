### Heyoooo!

I'm Tabs! Developer, designer, and self-starter. Outside of work I stream, work on a ton of side projects, lead communities, mentor, and do 100 Day Challenges. Easy-going, but no chill.

You can find me on

#### Ongoing side projects

- âœ¨ Grid: chat-based community management software.
- ðŸ“” Of Course (name TBD): courseware supporting evidence-based education.
- ðŸ’Ž Cyberpunk TTRPG app: player assistant for quicker playing and custom mapping.


#### Managing communities

- Artifex ANU: a local community for creatives and tech people. I mentor students and freelancers.
- Atlantis: an interidisciplinary Twitch/Twitter community, similar to the above except more web dev, entrepreneurship, and coworking. 
- The Dragonfly Effect [Phi]: A video game community I've been running for 14 years.
